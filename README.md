## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. Open the `Insurance_Prediction_Model.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.
